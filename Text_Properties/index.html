    <h1>Milky Way</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>The <a href="#nowhere">Milkey Way</a> is the galaxy that includes the Solar System,
        with the name describing the galaxy's appearance from Earth:
        a hazy band of light seen in the night sky formed from stars that
        cannot be individually distinguished by the naked eye.</p>

    <p>It is estimated to contain 100-400 billion stars and at least that number of planets.
        The Solar System is located at a radius of about 27,000 light-years (8.3 kpc)
        from the Galactic Center, on the inner edge of the Orion Arm,
        one of the spiral-shaped concentrations of gas and dust.</p>

    <h2>Telescopic observations</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Proof of the Milky Way consisting of many stars came in 1610 when
        Galileo Galilei used a telescope to study the Milky Way and discovered
        that it is composed of a huge number of faint stars.
        Galileo also concluded that the appearance of the Milky Way was
        due to refraction of the Earth's atmosphere.</p>

    <h3>Size</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>The Milky Way is one of the two largest galaxies in the Local Group
        (the other being the Andromeda Galaxy), although the size for its
        galactic disc and how much it defines the isophotal diameter is not
        well understood.[11] It is estimated that the significant bulk of
        stars in the galaxy lies within the 26 kiloparsecs (80,000 light-years)
        diameter, and that the number of stars beyond the outermost disc
        dramatically reduces to a very low number, with respect to an
        extrapolation of the exponential disk with the scale length of the
        inner disc</p>
