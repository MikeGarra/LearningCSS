    <h1>Working with Hex Colors</h1>
<body>
    <p>Uses six hexadecimal numbers (0-9 and A-F) to represent the same color values as RGB. 
        The first two numbers represent red, the middle two represent green, and the last two represent blue. 
        Hex is often used in website design and development because the short six-character code makes it easier to identify a color.</p>
